# CR2-U v0.4.4

A from-scratch reimplementation of *Chaos Rings II* for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android.

## What's new

- **HD models:** a model with pictures of its own could crash the game when it loaded again; it no longer does, and its old textures no longer pile up on the GPU.
- **Menu text:** the text cache no longer grows for the whole session.
- **HD textures:** `--export-textures` now writes ordinary PNGs and the game reads PNG replacements, so any upscaler or editor works without a converter. A replacement that doesn't keep its picture's shape is skipped and named in the log, instead of breaking the menus.

The HD model crash was reproduced and its fix checked under the sanitizers. Physical Android devices and a real Windows PC without Vulkan are still untested.

## Getting started

1. Download the file for your system and unzip it.
2. Start `cr2view`. If it can't find your copy of the game, it asks you for one and sets it up.
3. Play.

- **Windows:** if SmartScreen warns about an unsigned program, choose *More info*, *Run anyway*.
- **macOS:** right-click `cr2view.app` and choose *Open* (it isn't signed).
- **Linux:** `chmod +x` the AppImage, then run it.
- **Android:** install the APK, then copy your game files over USB into
  `Android/data/local.preservation.chaosrings2/files/`, in an `ios/`, `android/` or `vita/` folder.

The README's "Your copy" section lists exactly which files each release needs.

## Good to know

- **No game data is included.** You need your own copy; the port reads it at run time.
- **Tested on:** Linux (played), Windows (under Wine). The macOS and Android builds are made by CI
  but haven't been run on real hardware yet. Reports are welcome.
- **DLSS** isn't in these builds (NVIDIA's library can't ship with GPL code); you can build it
  yourself (README, Platforms).
- Licence GPL-2.0-or-later (the macOS app is GPL-3.0 because of MoltenVK). A fan preservation
  project, not affiliated with Square Enix or Media.Vision.
